      <h2 class="section__header">01 THE AMG STORY</h2>
      <p>
        Under the hood, the GT 63 PRO is packing a thunderous AMG 4.0L V8
        biturbo engine that's ready to roar. This German powerhouse churns out a
        <br />
        whopping 603 hp - that's 26 hp more than its predecessor, the AMG GT 63.
        What about torque? Well, it's got plenty of that as well - an
        impressive<br />
        627 lb-ft to be precise - ensuring you get that thrilling acceleration
        every time you hit the gas. This AMG beauty can rocket from 0 to 60
        mph<br />
        in an estimated 3.1 seconds, but what really shows that this thing can
        pull is that it can carry on to 124 mph in just 10.9 seconds, and
        then<br />
        top out at a max speed of 197 mph. That's some serious performance!
      </p>

      <p>
        The engineers at Affalterbach have also boosted the cooling systems,
        adding two radiators in the front wheel arches to keep everything<br />
        running smoothly even during the most intense drives. The cooling for
        the front and rear differentials, along with the transfer case, is<br />
        top-notch, thanks to the new geometry of the air vanes and revised brake
        cover plates. This means you can push the GT 63 PRO to its limits<br />
        without worrying about overheating - and great for intense track days
        when you want to summon your inner Lewis Hamilton.

          This is a Mercedes-AMG, so no surprises here when we say that the GT
          63 PRO is a stunner. This new 'PRO' version of the GT 63 gets an <br>
          aggressive front fascia with carbon fiber air deflectors and enlarged
          side air intakes that gives it a menacing look even when it's not<br>
          racing from '0-100 real quick'. The fixed rear wing and underbody air
          deflectors were inspired by the Mercedes-AMG ONE, and they are purely<br>
          functional as they enhance the aerodynamics by reducing lift and
          increasing downforce for better stability and handling. The AMG<br>
          Aerodynamics Package, which includes the Airpanel active air control
          system, comes standard and helps the car slice through the air<br>
          effortlessly. The AMG Exterior Carbon Fiber Package adds a touch of
          high-tech elegance with carbon fiber accents on the front splitter,<br>
          side sills, rear diffuser, and rear wing.
